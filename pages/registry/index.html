  The biggest thing on our wish list is the chance to celebrate together with
  family and friends! Gifts are not required, but if you would like to send one,
  we have a couple of suggestions. Whatever you may decide, gifts and donations
  can be sent to:

    <p class="sans-serif">Donate to Plan International!</p>
    <p class="copy">
      Consider a donation to Plan International, an organization dedicated to
      improving the lives of vulnerable children in developing countries. Young
      women in the developing world are more likely to be forced into an early
      marriage, be subjected to violence, be sold into the sex trade, or become
      infected with HIV. Often, girls face discrimination in their own homes. In
      many cases, they have limited access to a doctor or even a primary
      education (if they're able to go to school at all). The <a
      href="https://plan-international.org/girls/" target="_blank">Because I am
      a Girl</a> campaign is dedicated to empowering young women in these
      situations by supplying them with basic human rights such as food,
      healthcare, security and education.
      <br><br>
      We encourage you to investigate the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://plan-international.org/girls/">Because I am a Girl</a>
      website, and if you are interested in donating to this cause you can make
      a check out to <a href="http://plan-international.org/"
      target="_blank">Plan International</a> with a memo of <a target="_blank"
      href="https://plan-international.org/girls/">Because I am a Girl</a> and
      mail it to Lillian Dunlap at the address above. We are happy to handle
      final donations so that you can avoid being added to any unwanted mailing
      lists.

      Help fund the honeymoon. As many of you know, we're big travel lovers! We
      haven't chosen a honeymoon destination yet. There are just too many great
      places to choose from! We may go snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef, or
      try a Safari in South Africa or Tanzania, or take a train trip through
      Europe! If you'd like to help us get to our destination, you can mail a
      check to Lillian or Danny at the above address.
